# LCR Circuit

## Description

A project designed to model an LCR circuit. This project aims to allow the user to define a variable length LCR circuit,
where components may be in series or parallel. The correct impedance will then be displayed.

## Motivation

This was originally a university project, I am refactoring it to:

* Brush up on my C++ skills and syntax knowledge.
* Implement new design changes now I have been in industry for a year.
* Have an example of my up to date (2024) programming skills/standards.

## Usage

I am not a C++ developer by trade so I do not intend to package this properly so it can be installed and deployed that
way. Instead I shall compile the code on my machine and push the executable to this repository.  

**Note/ I understand the risks of running a pre-compiled binary, so if you are not comfortable doing that please
re-compile it on your machine.**  

I also do not intend to provide this as a docker container so if you wish to run this configuring dependancies is for
you to complete. That being said I do not intend to use anything other than STL C++ libraries.

find some of his teaching materials on YouTube, search for Niels Walet and he should come up.
